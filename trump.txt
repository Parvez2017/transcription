trump_8|There's never been a time
trump_9|like this where
trump_10|such a thing happened,
trump_11|where they could take it away from all of us,
trump_12|from me, from you from our country.
trump_13|This was a fraudulent election.
trump_14|But we can't play into the hands
trump_15|of these people.
trump_16|We have to have peace.
trump_17|So go home.
