1
0.93 --> 3.26
I know your pain. I know you're hurt.

2
3.94 --> 9.17
We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a

3
8.34 --> 9.91
landslide election.

4
9.92 --> 13.35
And everyone knows it, especially the other side.

5
14.04 --> 16.51
But you have to go home now. We

6
16.31 --> 17.4
have to have peace.

7
17.84 --> 23.23
We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order.

8
23.49 --> 27.09
We don't want anybody hurt. It's a very tough period of time.

9
27.4 --> 28.78
There's never been a time

10
28.54 --> 30.72
like this where

11
30.34 --> 31.84
such a thing happened,

12
31.7 --> 34.0
where they could take it away from all of us,

13
34.09 --> 36.15
from me, from you from our country.

14
36.74 --> 39.65
This was a fraudulent election.

15
39.44 --> 42.16
But we can't play into the hands

16
41.99 --> 42.95
of these people.

17
44.04 --> 46.36
We have to have peace.

18
46.04 --> 47.17
So go home.

19
47.67 --> 49.96
We love you. You're very special.

20
50.44 --> 52.33
You've seen what happens. You see

21
52.21 --> 56.35
the way others air treated that are so bad and so evil.

22
57.14 --> 61.45
I know how you feel, but go home and go home in peace.
